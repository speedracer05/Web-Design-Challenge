## Background
I used the information created in my analysis of the [How's the Weather, "Impact of Latitude on Weather conditions"](https://github.com/speedracer05/python-api-challenge) to present the information in a visualization dashboard website. In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot, and a means to navigate between them. The pages contain the visualizations and my corresponding explanations. In addition, there is a landing page, a page comparing the plots, and another page to view the data used to build them. The website will update the scale of the format depending on the size screen the user is viewing it on.
